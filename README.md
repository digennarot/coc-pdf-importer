# Call of Cthulhu PDF Importer

**English** · [Italiano](README.it.md)

## What's new

- **Horror on the Orient Express** (English edition, Chaosium boxed set):
  the NPCs, creatures and pre-generated investigators of Books II–V are
  imported. Book I has no stat blocks. The books' layout needed its own
  handling: ALL-CAPS names with nicknames and aliases (`"THE CRAWLING ONE (AKA
  …)"`), small-caps surnames (`LaVERGE`), descriptor-first pre-gen headings,
  column tables for groups (Sarnathians, Nightgaunts, Shantaks), open-ended
  values (`EDU 99+`), and weapon or spell prose kept out of attack names.
- **Words hyphenated across a line** (`de- flects`, `Sur- geon`) are rejoined
  in every imported field: names, occupations, attack notes, armor, Sanity
  loss, spells, gear and background text.
- The module now lives in [digennarot's fork](https://github.com/digennarot/coc-pdf-importer),
  with CI on every push and an automatic GitHub release on every push to
  `main` (see [Releasing](#releasing)).

## Overview

Import content from documents that use the standard Chaosium layout into the
[CoC7 system](https://github.com/Miskatonic-Investigative-Society/CoC7-FoundryVTT).
Requires Foundry VTT v13+.

Tested on the following documents:

- Masks of Nyarlathotep (campaign book and Keeper Reference Booklet)
- Escape from Innsmouth
- The Two-Headed Serpent (campaign book and Keeper Reference Booklet)
- Down Darker Trails (setting book and Keeper Reference Booklet)
- Pulp Cthulhu
- CoC7 Quick Start
- CoC7 Keeper Rulebook (Part 3: Scenarios)
- Gateways to Terror
- Doors to Darkness
- Dead Light and Other Dark Turns
- Does Love Forgive
- Mansions of Madness
- The Lightless Beacon
- Horror on the Orient Express (English edition, Books II–V)

Only the English editions are supported: the parser reads the English stat
labels (STR, CON, SIZ…), so translated books such as the Italian
"Orrore sull'Orient Express" are not imported yet.

A single import reads a document once and creates both **actors** and, when the
document contains them, **items** (Pulp Cthulhu talents/archetypes, Chaosium
appendix Spells / Tomes / Artefacts, and Down Darker Trails' Old West
occupations, skills, weapons and spells). Everything is placed in folders named
after the source file; a re-import refreshes same-named entries instead of
duplicating them.

### Actors

Import actors from the various flavors of the standard stat block layout —
"Name, age N, description" blocks, pre-generated investigator sheets, monster
"average / rolls" tables, multi-column tables for NPC groups, and the
two-column layouts of the newer books (Innsmouth). Each block yields
characteristics, derived stats, combat, skills, languages, spells, Sanity loss,
armor, and — for pre-gens — the background sections and gear. Names printed in
ALL CAPS are proper-cased on import, and a stat block never absorbs text from
beyond its own pages, so long scenario prose stays out of the sheets.

Where the CoC7 system has a matching compendium item, the importer adopts it so
imported content keeps the real CoCID, icon, and properties:

- **Weapons** are matched to the system's weapon compendium (core content
  preferred over the wiki fallback), with size/alias handling for common melee
  and firearm names and correct thrown-weapon profiles. The book's printed
  damage always wins, but impale/range/skill metadata comes from the match.
- **Skills** are created with their specialization filled in, so specialized and
  "(Any)" skills don't prompt the sheet for a name on import.

Note that the importer skips large portions of description prose — maneuver
mechanics, creature flavor, and the like — so consult the source documents when
running the game.

### Pulp variants

Some books (Masks of Nyarlathotep, Escape from Innsmouth, The Two-Headed
Serpent) print optional **Pulp Combat** and **Pulp Talents** sections inside a
stat block. Such an actor is imported twice: the standard version into the
document's folder, and a Pulp variant into a sibling `<file name> (Pulp)` Actor
folder, created only when the document has at least one. The variant takes the
pulp combat profiles in place of the standard ones (and, where printed, the
pulp HP and Luck), and carries its talents as `talent` items. An existing
talent of the same name in the world is used (icon, category and CoCID kept)
but reads with the book's own description; otherwise an inline talent with
that description is created.

### Pulp Talents & Archetypes

The 40 player talents and 22 archetypes from the Pulp Cthulhu rulebook are
parsed and imported as CoC7 `talent` and `archetype` items. Archetypes carry
their core characteristic(s), bonus points, suggested occupations/traits, talent
count, and a resolved skill list (each skill mapped to its CoCID itemKey).

Items are filed in a `<file name>` **Item** folder with one subfolder per type
(`Talents`, `Archetypes`, `Spells`, `Tomes`, `Artefacts`, …); actors live at
the top level of a same-named **Actor** folder. (Foundry keeps Actor and Item
folders in separate trees, so these are two sibling folders of the same name.)

### Down Darker Trails

The Old West sourcebook's reference chapters are imported as items: the 26
occupations, its altered and new skills, the firearm and melee weapon tables,
and the shamanic / folk magic spells.

### Spells, Tomes & Artefacts

Books that include Chaosium appendix sections (e.g. Masks of Nyarlathotep
Appendices B–D), or that print appendix-style entries inline in their chapters
(Escape from Innsmouth), yield world items:

- **Spells** — name, casting time, legacy cost fields (MP / SAN / POW / HP), and
  description body. Automated `costList` steps are not generated.
- **Tomes** — bibliographic metadata, Sanity / Mythos stats, study time; Link,
  Relevance, and spell lists go in the keeper notes (no spell item linking).
- **Artefacts** — full text in keeper notes; Foundry `weapon` when the body
  looks combat-capable, otherwise generic `item`. Nested under region folders
  when the appendix prints chapter banners (`Artefacts/Peru/…`).
- **Tomes** — also nest under region folders when a banner is present
  (`Tomes/Egypt/…`).

## Usage

1. Install the module from

   ```console
   https://github.com/digennarot/coc-pdf-importer/releases/latest/download/module.json
   ```

2. Go to Settings → Game Settings → Call of Cthulhu PDF Importer → Import button
3. Upload the document(s) and wait until the import is complete
4. Navigate to the Actors or Items sidebar. Entries are created in folders named
   after the source file (items under typed subfolders such as `Talents` /
   `Spells` / `Tomes` / `Artefacts`).

## Development

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** (developed on Node 26). TypeScript sources are run directly
  via `node --experimental-strip-types`, so there is **no separate transpile
  step** for tests or tooling.
- `npm install` to pull dependencies (`pdfjs-dist`, `math.sumprecise`, and the
  dev toolchain: `esbuild`, `typescript`, `prettier`, `@thednp/dommatrix`).
- **7-Zip** is required only for `npm run build:module` (the release zip): the
  `7z` CLI on Windows, `7zz` (p7zip) on Linux/macOS.

### How it works

Parsing is split from Foundry entirely: `process.ts`, `pulp.ts`, `appendix.ts`
and `oldwest.ts` never touch the Foundry API, which is what makes them directly
testable.

1. **Extraction & parsing** — `processPDF()` (in `process.ts`) uses `pdfjs-dist`
   to read every page's text runs **once**, keeping each run's font size. From
   that shared representation it runs independent parsers and returns
   `{ actors, items }`:
   - the **actor parser** strips repeating page furniture, finds stat-block
     anchors (the `STR … CON` run), recovers each block's name/age/description
     (using font size and page boundaries to separate a heading from body
     prose), and parses the stats into `CocCharacter`s. Multi-column group
     tables expand to one character per column.
   - the **item parsers** (`pulp.ts`, `appendix.ts`, `oldwest.ts`) read pulp
     talent/archetype tables, Chaosium appendix Spells/Tomes/Artefacts, and the
     Down Darker Trails reference chapters into internal item structures. Each
     is guarded by its book's own section markers, so a document without those
     sections yields no items. Source-faithful data stays unresolved (e.g. skill
     _names_, not CoCIDs).
2. **Import** — `importDocument()` (in `document.ts`) creates the world
   documents:
   - actors via `importCharacters()` (`importer.ts`), which maps each
     `CocCharacter` onto CoC7 actor system data and embedded items (skills,
     weapons + backing skills, spells), at the top level of a `<file name>`
     Actor folder.
   - items via `createPulpItems()` (`document.ts`), which builds the Foundry
     documents (resolving pulp skill names to CoCID itemKeys here) and files
     them under typed subfolders of a `<file name>` Item folder.

   A re-import replaces same-named entries in each folder instead of duplicating.

### npm scripts

Copy `fvtt.config.example.js` → `fvtt.config.js` and set `userDataPath` to your
Foundry user data folder (e.g. `/Users/YOU/foundrydata`). Builds then land in
`Data/modules/coc-pdf-importer/` under that path.

- `npm run dev` — esbuild in watch mode → rebuilds the module into Foundry’s
  `Data/modules/coc-pdf-importer/` (or repo root if `userDataPath` is unset)
- `npm run build` — one-off production bundle to the same destination
  (`module.js` + source map + pdf.js worker + `module.json` / `lang` /
  `templates`)
- `npm run build:module` — **release** build → `build/module.zip` +
  `build/module.json` (requires 7-Zip)
- `npm run release` — interactive: shows the current version, asks for the new
  one, and commits the version bump (`module.json` + `package.json` +
  `package-lock.json`) as `Release <version>`; pushing `main` then lets the
  release workflow tag, build and publish it
- `npm run type-check` — `tsc --noEmit` over `src/`, `test/`, `tools/`
- `npm test` — unit tests (fast, fixture-free, CI)
- `npm run test:integration` — book-level tests + golden snapshots — **needs the
  fixtures**
- `npm run dump:json` — parse every fixture (or one: `-- "<file.pdf>"`) →
  `out/<name>.json` (each file holds `{ actors, items }`)
- `npm run dump:text` — dump raw pdf.js text of a fixture → `out/<name>.txt`
  (for debugging extraction)

### Testing

Three tiers:

- **Unit** (`src/*.test.ts`, run by `npm test`) — fast, self-contained checks:
  the parsers against synthetic stat-block / reference text, and the Foundry
  builders against a mock harness. These use generic placeholder names, no
  copyrighted text, and are the CI gate.
- **Integration** (`test/integration/process.integration.test.ts`) — parse the
  real PDFs and assert on specific characters. Requires the fixtures.
- **Golden snapshots** (`test/integration/golden.test.ts`) — re-parse each
  fixture and compare the full `{ actors, items }` output byte-for-byte against
  `golden/<name>.json`, plus an assertion that no actor falls back to an
  "Unknown" name. This is the backward-compatibility guard: refactor the parsers
  freely, then confirm the snapshots are unchanged. To accept an intentional
  output change, run `npm run dump:json` and copy `out/*.json` into `golden/`.

The PDFs and snapshots are copyrighted and gitignored; integration and golden
tests **skip** when they're absent. See `fixtures/README.md` for the setup.

### The `Math.sumPrecise` / `DOMMatrix` shims

pdf.js needs `Math.sumPrecise` (recent JS) and a DOM `DOMMatrix`, which are
missing in Node and in older browsers. They are installed in three contexts:

- **Node** (tests + tooling): `node-setup.ts`, loaded via `--import`.
- **Browser main thread**: `import "math.sumprecise/auto"` at the top of
  `index.ts`, bundled into `module.js`.
- **Browser pdf.js worker**: `tools/copy-worker.js` prepends the shim to
  `pdf.worker.min.mjs` when it's copied into a build.

Without the worker shim, text extraction silently truncates glyph runs.

### Building for release

`npm run build:module` produces two artifacts in `build/`:

- `module.zip` — the installable module, packed with 7-Zip at ultra compression.
  It contains `module.json`, `module.js` (+ source map), the shimmed
  `pdf.worker.min.mjs`, and the `lang/` and `templates/` folders.
- `module.json` — a copy of the manifest served next to the zip, so a release's
  manifest URL can point at it while the download URL points at `module.zip`.

7-Zip must be installed (`7z` or `7zz` on PATH).

### Releasing

Every push to `main` is released. A push that does not bump the version itself
gets the next patch version automatically (`[minor]` / `[major]` in a pushed
commit's subject line picks the next minor / major instead; `[skip release]`
skips it; markers in a message body are ignored): the workflow commits the bump as `Release <version>` to `main`. To choose
the version by hand, push your own `Release <version>` commit (see
`npm run release`). The release workflow then tags the version, builds the
module, and creates the
GitHub release with `module.zip` and `module.json` attached. It then publishes
the version to the [Foundry VTT package listing](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/coc-pdf-importer)
through the Package Release API, pointing at that release's own `module.json`
asset and its release page, with the compatibility range taken from
`module.json` (`maximum` only when declared there).

The Foundry step needs a `FOUNDRY_RELEASE_TOKEN` repository secret holding the
package's release token (`fvttp_…`, generated on the package's foundryvtt.com
page); without it the step is skipped with a warning and the GitHub release
still goes out.
